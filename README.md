# SOCS0100 Computational Social Science: assignment 1

## What the Project Does
I chose the 'covid 19 cases and deaths database' to demonstrate my understanding on R programming through the use of **Tidyverse libraries (`dplyr`, `tidyr`, `ggplot2` etc)**, I
- Explore and contextualise the chosen dataset;
- Perform data cleaning, transformation, and variable creation;
- Write at least one custom function for both data-wrangling and visualisation tasks;
- Produce descriptive and graphical summaries that reveal meaningful social-science patterns;
- Critically evaluate GitHub Copilotâ€™s contribution to code development;
- Package all materials (report, code, figures, and this README) in a reproducible zipped folder.

## How to Get Started

1. Component of my assignment(zipped folder)
   This assignment include:
   - a 1500 words explanation and AI reflection
   - Two section of R script(I. data exploration, processing and functional programming; II. data visualisation), which gives the detailed code and note
   - R project 
   - Results from visualisation
   - README file(this one)
   - coversheet
     
3. Install required R packages
   ```r
   install.packages(c("tidyverse", "knitr", "kableExtra", "ggplot2")
